# Does Card Counting work?

As many other people, I was wondering weather Card Counting in BlackJack works or not. 

Luckily for me, I don't have to trust anyone's word for it and I can just
test it myself, thanks to my programming skills.

If you want to try messing with how much profit you can make with 
however many games you'd like, you can clone this repository and 
initialize it using npm or yawn. 

If you want to modify the amount of games played, the amount of rounds 
per game or even the amount of shoes played per game, there is a dedicated variable
for each of them at the top of the code.

They are fittingly named:
"Games", "NumberOfRounds" and "Shoes"

If you encounter any problems or have any questions / suggestions, you can let me know
wherever you can, and I'll respond ASAP.

Thanks for reading and enjoy! ^^
